This document answers common questions from people who are curious about Liberation Mass but may not be familiar with its language or ideas.

## 1. Basics

### ❓ What is Liberation Mass?

Liberation Mass is a community gathering. It’s a space where people share food, ideas, art, and care. Think of it like a mix between a community dinner, a skillshare, and a festival — with a touch of ritual to help us feel connected. *(See also [Participation](#2-participation) for how you can be involved.)*

### ❓ Why call it a “Mass”? Isn’t that religious?

We use the word “mass” as a metaphor — it means a large gathering, a coming together. It’s not tied to any religion. We borrow the language of ritual because humans everywhere use ritual to create meaning and connection. *(See also [Community & Values](#3-community--values) for guiding principles.)*

### ❓ Do I have to believe in anything to participate?

Nope. People of any faith or no faith are welcome. Liberation Mass is about dignity, consent, and connection. You bring your own beliefs — or none — and that’s respected.

### ❓ What actually happens at a Liberation Mass?

The flow can vary, but usually includes:

* **Invocation** — an opening to set the tone.
* **Witnessing** — space for short stories, reflections, or readings.
* **Skillshare/Teaching** — a practical demo or shared knowledge.
* **Communion** — sharing food, water, or seeds.
* **Art & Dance** — music, performance, creativity.
* **Closing** — gratitude, next steps, goodbyes.

*(See also [Food & Families](#4-food--families) and [Accessibility & Safety](#5-accessibility--safety) for more details on meals and spaces.)*

### ❓ How often do gatherings happen?

It depends on the community. Some groups meet monthly, others seasonally, and others only when the need or energy arises. The rhythm is set by the people involved.

### ❓ Do I need to prepare anything before attending?

No preparation required. Just come as you are. If you’d like, you can bring food, a poem, a song, or simply an open heart. *(See [Participation](#2-participation) for ways to engage.)*

## 2. Participation

### ❓ Who can come?

Anyone who comes in good faith and respects consent and safety. Families, individuals, newcomers, old friends — all are welcome. *(See [Accessibility & Safety](#5-accessibility--safety) for expectations.)*

### ❓ What if I’m shy or just want to watch?

That’s completely fine. Participation is always opt-in. You can sit back, listen, eat, and leave whenever you want. No pressure.

### ❓ Do I have to perform, teach, or speak?

Not at all. Some people like to share art, skills, or stories; others prefer to listen and participate quietly. All roles are valued. Simply being present is contribution enough.

### ❓ Does it cost money?

No. We share what we have. Sometimes people bring food, art, or resources; sometimes they just bring themselves. All are welcome. *(See [Food & Families](#4-food--families) for more on meals.)*

### ❓ Do I have to RSVP?

Some groups may ask for RSVPs to plan food or space, but generally, gatherings are open. If you’re unsure, check the announcement or ask the organizers.

### ❓ Can I bring a friend?

Absolutely. Invite anyone you think would benefit from a welcoming, liberatory space.

### ❓ What should I wear?

Whatever makes you comfortable. Some people dress casually, others bring expressive or creative outfits. There’s no dress code.

## 3. Community & Values

### ❓ Why do you focus on “liberation”?

Because too many systems hold people back — whether through injustice, inequality, or isolation. Liberation Mass is about practicing freedom, care, and mutual aid together, right now.

### ❓ Is it political?

Everything touches politics because politics shape our lives. But Liberation Mass isn’t a campaign or a rally. It’s about community, care, and dignity — things everyone deserves.

### ❓ What if I disagree with something said or done?

That’s okay. We expect differences of opinion. The key is to approach disagreements with respect and curiosity, not hostility. Dialogue is welcome as long as it honors consent and safety. *(See [Accessibility & Safety](#5-accessibility--safety) for conflict resolution.)*

### ❓ Why should I come?

Because you’ll find connection, care, and joy. Because it’s a chance to share your gifts and learn from others. Because in a world that can feel isolating, we need spaces to come together and practice something better.

### ❓ What values guide Liberation Mass?

* **Consent & Dignity** — everyone has the right to safety and respect.
* **Mutual Aid** — sharing what we have to meet each other’s needs.
* **Decentralization** — no permanent leaders; roles rotate.
* **Accountability** — harm is named and addressed, not ignored.
* **Creativity** — art, ritual, and play are central to connection.

## 4. Food & Families

### ❓ Will there be food? What if I have dietary needs?

Food is often part of the gathering — usually potluck-style or simple shared meals. We aim for inclusivity: labeling food, offering vegan and allergen-friendly options, and encouraging people to bring what they can eat and share. No one is excluded if they can’t bring food. *(See [Participation](#2-participation) for cost details.)*

### ❓ Is it family-friendly? Can kids come?

Yes! Children and families are welcome. We encourage creating spaces where kids can play, learn, and contribute. Some events may include activities designed with young people in mind.

### ❓ What about alcohol or substances?

Each community decides. Many gatherings are alcohol-free to keep the space welcoming and safe for all ages. Substance use should never compromise safety, consent, or accessibility. *(See [Accessibility & Safety](#5-accessibility--safety) for rules on safety.)*

### ❓ Can I bring food from a store instead of cooking?

Of course. Homemade food is wonderful, but store-bought snacks, fruit, or drinks are just as welcome.

## 5. Accessibility & Safety

### ❓ Is it accessible?

We strive for accessibility. That includes:

* Publishing access notes for each gathering (stairs, ramps, restrooms, etc.)
* Providing captions or interpreters when possible
* Offering quiet/chill spaces
* Adjusting rituals or flows so everyone can participate comfortably
  If you have access needs, we invite you to let organizers know in advance.

### ❓ How do you make sure the space is safe?

Safety is a priority. We set clear boundaries: consent, dignity, and respect are non-negotiable. If harm occurs, we practice accountability and conflict resolution, aiming for repair rather than punishment. Stewards may be present to help hold the space. *(See also [Community & Values](#3-community--values).)*

### ❓ What if someone behaves badly?

If someone causes harm or breaks consent, they may be asked to leave. Repeated or serious harm is not tolerated. Safety of the group comes first.

### ❓ Are there quiet spaces?

Yes, we aim to provide areas for rest and decompression. Participation is opt-in, and breaks are always encouraged. *(See [Basics](#1-basics) for what happens at gatherings.)*

## 6. Hosting & Growth

### ❓ Can I host a Liberation Mass in my community?

Yes! Liberation Mass is meant to be decentralized. Anyone can start one, as long as the core principles are followed: consent, safety, dignity, mutual aid, and decentralization. We encourage sharing guides, flows, and resources so local groups can adapt them.

### ❓ How do I get involved beyond attending?

There are many ways:

* Bring food, art, or a song to share
* Offer a skillshare or short teaching
* Help with setup, cleanup, or accessibility
* Spread the word to friends and community
* Volunteer as a Steward to help hold space safely *(See [Accessibility & Safety](#5-accessibility--safety).)*
  Participation can be small or large — it all matters.

### ❓ How do I connect with others doing this elsewhere?

Check the repo, zines, or community spaces where Liberation Mass is shared. Many groups post updates online or link up through commons-based networks. Ask organizers at your local gathering for ways to plug in.

### ❓ What resources are available for new hosts?

Guides, templates, and sample flows are included in the Liberation Mass repo. Experienced organizers are encouraged to share their notes and help mentor new hosts.

## 7. Big Picture

### ❓ What’s the long-term vision?

The goal is to weave a network of liberatory spaces where people can come together regularly to share dignity, care, and joy. Over time, this can grow into stronger mutual aid, deeper relationships, and resilience in the face of oppressive systems.

### ❓ How is Liberation Mass different from a religion, cult, or political group?

* **Not religion:** no required beliefs or doctrines.
* **Not cult:** no secrecy, coercion, or control; participation is voluntary and transparent.
* **Not a political party:** no endorsements, elections, or candidates.
  It is simply a practice of gathering in liberatory, inclusive ways. *(See [Community & Values](#3-community--values).)*

### ❓ Where can I learn more?

Start with the Liberation Mass repo, where resources, zines, and guides are shared. New materials and stories are added as the practice grows. *(See also the [Objections FAQ](FAQ-Objections.md) for myth-busting.)*

### ❓ How do you measure success?

Not in numbers or money, but in connection, joy, and care. If people leave feeling seen, respected, and nourished, that is success.

### ❓ What if I don’t agree with everything?

You don’t have to. Liberation Mass is not about total agreement; it’s about shared practice. We expect diversity of thought and experience. *(See [Participation](#2-participation) for opt-in approach.)*
