This document answers common questions from people who are curious about Liberation Mass but may not be familiar with its language or ideas.

---

## 1. Basics

### ❓ What is Liberation Mass?

Liberation Mass is a **community gathering framework**. It brings people together to share food, ideas, art, and care while also coordinating practical support. Think of it as a mix between a community dinner, a planning meeting, and a cultural event. Some groups include symbolic elements (like an opening or closing), but there are no required beliefs.
*(See the [README](README.md) for a full overview.)*

### ❓ Why call it a “Mass”? Isn’t that religious?

We use the word **mass** in its everyday sense: *a gathering of many people*. It’s not religious, and there are no doctrines to believe. We borrow familiar words like "mass" or "invocation" because they help set tone and meaning, but we redefine them in secular, open ways.
*(See also [Community & Values](#3-community--values) and [Objections FAQ](FAQ-Objections.md).)*

### ❓ Do I have to believe in anything to participate?

No. People of any faith or no faith are welcome. Liberation Mass is about dignity, consent, and connection. You bring your own beliefs — or none — and that’s respected.

### ❓ What actually happens at a Liberation Mass?

The flow can vary, but often includes:

* **Welcome & Opening (Invocation)** — something to set the tone.
* **Stories & Sharing (Witnessing)** — short testimonies, poems, or reflections.
* **Skillshare / Teaching** — a practical demo or shared knowledge.
* **Meal or Exchange (Communion)** — sharing food, water, seeds, or resources.
* **Music / Art** — performance, dance, or creative expression.
* **Closing** — gratitude, reflection, or next steps.

*(See also [Food & Families](#4-food--families), [Accessibility & Safety](#5-accessibility--safety), and [Gathering Agenda](README.md#gathering-agenda).)*

### ❓ How often do gatherings happen?

It depends on the community. Some groups meet monthly, others seasonally, others when there is a need. The rhythm is set locally.

### ❓ Do I need to prepare anything before attending?

No preparation is required. Come as you are. If you like, you can bring food, art, or simply yourself.
*(See [Participation](#2-participation) for details.)*

## 2. Participation

### ❓ Who can come?

Anyone who comes in good faith and respects consent and safety. Families, individuals, newcomers, and old friends are all welcome — though see [Food & Families](#4-food--families) for notes on kids.

### ❓ What if I’m shy or just want to watch?

That’s completely fine. Participation is always opt-in. You can sit back, listen, and leave when you wish.

### ❓ Do I have to perform, teach, or speak?

Not at all. Sharing is welcome but never required. Some people like to share art, skills, or stories; others prefer to listen and participate quietly. All roles are valued. Simply being present is contribution enough.

### ❓ Does it cost money?

No. People contribute what they can — food, art, or time — but money is never required.

### ❓ Do I have to RSVP?

Sometimes yes, if food or space needs planning. Otherwise, gatherings are usually open. Check with organizers.

### ❓ Can I bring a friend?

Absolutely. Bring anyone who would benefit from a welcoming, supportive space.

### ❓ What should I wear?

There is no dress code. People dress casually, creatively, expressively, or sometimes choose not to wear clothing at all. What matters is consent and respect: everyone has the right to comfort, boundaries, and safety.

## 3. Community & Values

### ❓ Why do you focus on “liberation”?

Because too many systems hold people back. Liberation Mass is about practicing freedom, care, and mutual aid together in everyday ways.

### ❓ Is it political?

Politics shape our lives, but this is not a campaign or a rally. It’s about connection, dignity, and care — things everyone deserves.

### ❓ What if I disagree with something?

Disagreement is expected. The key is to engage respectfully. Dialogue is welcome when it honors consent and safety.

### ❓ Why should I come?

Because it’s a chance to find connection, share gifts, and learn from others. In a world that often feels isolating, this is a place to practice something better.

### ❓ What values guide Liberation Mass?

* **Consent & Dignity** — safety and respect for all.
* **Mutual Aid** — sharing resources to meet needs.
* **Decentralization** — no fixed leaders; rotating roles.
* **Accountability** — harm is addressed, not ignored.
* **Creativity** — art and play are central to connection.

## 4. Food & Families

### ❓ Will there be food? What if I have dietary needs?

Food is common but optional. Potlucks, shared snacks, or meals often happen. We encourage labeling dishes and including vegan or allergen-friendly options, and encouraging people to bring what they can eat and share. No one is excluded if they can’t bring food.

### ❓ Is it family-friendly?

Not always. Some gatherings may welcome kids, but others may not be appropriate — especially if people choose expressive or minimal clothing, or if the flow involves topics not suitable for children. Communities may decide to create **separate family-friendly versions** of Liberation Mass where kids can participate safely. Check the specific event notes if you’re considering bringing children.

### ❓ What about alcohol or substances?

Each group decides. Many keep gatherings alcohol-free so they’re safe and welcoming for most. Safety and consent always come first. *(See [Accessibility & Safety](#5-accessibility--safety) for rules on safety.)*

### ❓ Can I bring store-bought food?

Of course. Homemade or store-bought are equally welcome.

## 5. Accessibility & Safety

### ❓ Is it accessible?

We aim for accessibility. Notes on location (ramps, restrooms, etc.) are shared when possible. Quiet spaces, captions, and adjustments are encouraged. Let organizers know your needs.
*(See [Safety](README.md#-safety) for more.)*

### ❓ How is safety handled?

Consent and respect are non-negotiable. If harm happens, we address it directly, aiming for repair rather than punishment. Stewards or volunteers may be present for support.

### ❓ What if someone behaves badly?

They may be asked to leave. Repeated or serious harm is not tolerated. Group safety comes first.

### ❓ Are there quiet spaces?

Yes, many groups create areas for rest or sensory breaks.

## 6. Hosting & Growth

### ❓ Can I host a Liberation Mass?

Yes. Anyone can host, as long as core principles are followed: consent, safety, dignity, mutual aid, and decentralization.
*(See [Hosting & Growth in the README](README.md#-how-to-get-involved).)*

### ❓ How can I contribute?

Bring food or art, offer a skillshare, help with setup or accessibility, spread the word, or volunteer as a steward.

### ❓ How do I connect with others?

Check the repo, zines, or community spaces where groups share updates. Ask organizers at your local gathering.

### ❓ What resources are available?

Guides, sample flows, and hosting notes are provided in the repo. Organizers are encouraged to share what works for them.

## 7. Big Picture

### ❓ What’s the long-term vision?

To weave a network of spaces where people come together to share dignity, care, and joy. Over time, this builds stronger mutual aid and resilience.

### ❓ How is it different from a religion, cult, or political group?

* **Not religion:** no required beliefs.
* **Not cult:** no secrecy, coercion, or control.
* **Not political party:** no endorsements or candidates.

It’s simply a practice of gathering in inclusive, liberatory ways.
*(See [Objections FAQ](FAQ-Objections.md).)*

### ❓ Where can I learn more?

See the [README](README.md) for a full overview, plus guides, zines, and stories.
*(See also the [Objections FAQ](FAQ-Objections.md).)*

### ❓ How do you measure success?

By connection and care, not numbers or money. If people leave feeling seen and nourished, that’s success.

### ❓ What if I don’t agree with everything?

You don’t have to. Liberation Mass is about shared practice, not uniform belief.
