# Liberation Mass — Objections FAQ

This FAQ responds to common objections or suspicions people may have about Liberation Mass. The goal is clarity: explaining why we use the words we use, what Liberation Mass is *not*, and what it actually offers.

## 🕷️ Isn’t this just a "woke church"?

**No.** Liberation Mass is not a church, not a religion, and not a cult. It’s simply a gathering framework where people share food, ideas, art, and care. The word *mass* is used in its everyday sense: a coming together of many people. There are no doctrines, no conversions, and no leaders to obey.

---

## 🕷️ Why use words like "mass," "invocation," or "communion"?

Because words shape how we experience gathering. These words help create a sense of shared meaning. But here, they’re **reclaimed and redefined**:

* **Mass** = a large gathering, a critical mass of people. Not religion.
* **Invocation** = an opening gesture that helps us arrive together.
* **Communion** = sharing food, water, or seeds; nothing supernatural.

We use language that feels familiar but strip it of hierarchy or dogma. It’s about connection, not control.

## 🕷️ Is this anti-Christian or anti-religion?

No. People of any (or no) faith are welcome. Some participants may bring spiritual traditions with them; others may bring none. Liberation Mass respects both. Its foundation is dignity, consent, and connection.

---

## 🕷️ Is this a cult?

Absolutely not. Cults rely on secrecy, control, and coercion. Liberation Mass is the opposite:

* Participation is always opt-in.
* Leaving is always allowed.
* Roles rotate.
* Transparency and decentralization are built in.

There is no single leader, no doctrine, no demand for obedience.

## 🕷️ Is this just leftist, communist politics in disguise?

Everything is political because power shapes daily life. But Liberation Mass is not a political party or campaign. It’s about practicing dignity, care, and mutual aid in community. If that feels “political,” it’s only because human dignity itself has been politicized.

And yes, Liberation Mass is technically anarchist in nature — but by anarchism we don’t mean chaos or violence. We mean self-organization without hierarchy: people caring for each other directly, sharing responsibility, and rotating roles instead of handing power to permanent leaders. To us, anarchism simply means trust in people’s ability to cooperate, respect consent, and solve problems together without domination. It’s about freedom with responsibility, and connection without coercion.

---

## 🕷️ Why focus on liberation at all?

Because many people and communities are held back by unjust systems — economic, social, or environmental. Liberation Mass is one way to practice freedom and solidarity in everyday life. It’s not about abstract ideology; it’s about practical care.

---

## 🕷️ What about free speech? Can conservatives come?

Yes, if they come in good faith, with respect for consent, dignity, and safety. Dialogue is welcome. Harassment or hate is not. Free speech doesn’t mean freedom to cause harm.

---

## 🕷️ So why should I care?

Because everyone deserves spaces where care, dignity, and joy are unconditional. Liberation Mass offers a rhythm of **planning and connecting, acting and replenishing**, so communities don’t burn out and individuals don’t feel isolated.

It’s not about conversion. It’s about creating an open commons anyone can adapt.
