# Liberation Mass — Common Objections FAQ

This document addresses likely concerns and objections about Liberation Mass, especially from conservative, far-right, or skeptical audiences.

---

## ❓ Isn’t this just a “woke” church?

**No.** Liberation Mass is not a church, a religion, or a cult. It’s a gathering space where people share food, ideas, art, and care. The “mass” part is a metaphor: a collective ritual of solidarity, rooted in reality and science, not dogma.

We don’t seek to convert anyone; we invite participation in open, consent-based ways.

---

## ❓ Why all the focus on liberation?

Because too many people and communities are trapped by systems of domination — economic, political, social, and ecological. Liberation Mass is about creating spaces where we can breathe, connect, and imagine better futures together.

---

## ❓ Are you anti-Christian / anti-religion?

No. People of any (or no) faith are welcome. We honor science, reality, and lived experience. We also recognize that spiritual traditions, including Christianity, have both harmed and healed. Liberation Mass does not tell anyone what to believe; it focuses on shared dignity, consent, and connection.

---

## ❓ Why talk about oppression? Doesn’t that just divide people?

Naming harm is the first step toward healing. Pretending oppression doesn’t exist doesn’t make it go away — it just protects those who benefit from it. Liberation Mass is about creating accountability and care, not blame.

---

## ❓ Is this anti-capitalist?

We are openly critical of systems — including capitalism — that exploit people and the planet. That doesn’t mean we hate small businesses, workers, or everyday people trying to get by. Our critique is aimed at domination and harm, not at individuals surviving within it.

---

## ❓ Why are you against hierarchy? Don’t groups need leaders?

We practice decentralization: rotating roles, collective responsibility, and accountability. Leadership here means service, not domination. No one should hold power over others indefinitely.

---

## ❓ Isn’t this just leftist politics disguised as community?

Everything is political because power affects our lives. Liberation Mass isn’t a partisan campaign or a protest rally — it’s a community practice of care, mutual aid, and joy. If that looks “political,” it’s because dignity and justice matter.

---

## ❓ What about free speech? Can conservatives participate?

Yes — if they come in good faith, with respect for consent, dignity, and safety. We welcome dialogue, but not harassment, hate, or domination. Free speech is not a free pass to cause harm.

---

## ❓ Why use words like “souls,” “mass,” or “ritual”?

Because human beings have always used ritual, art, and story to create meaning. These words connect to history and emotion, but we redefine them in liberatory, secular, and inclusive ways. They are metaphors, not mandates.

---

## ❓ Is this a cult?

Absolutely not. Cults demand obedience, secrecy, and control. Liberation Mass emphasizes consent, exit at any time, decentralization, transparency, and accountability. The opposite of cult dynamics.

---

## ❓ Why should I care?

Because we all deserve spaces where dignity, care, and joy are not conditional. Because systems that divide and dominate can be resisted — not just by protest, but by living otherwise together. Liberation Mass is one way to practice that.
