# Liberation Mass

*A living, open-source ritual and commons of solidarity, healing, and freedom.*

Liberation Mass is not a church, not a cult, not a festival. It is a **gathering of souls** to practice radical empathy, celebrate reality and science, plan collective action, and imagine new worlds together. This README is intentionally **long and expansive**, offering everything you need to know in one place — so you don’t have to click around to piece it together.

## 🌑 What is Liberation Mass?

Liberation Mass has **two faces**:

* **The Commons** → coalition-style gatherings to share testimonies, coordinate, and plan collective action. (See [Commons Agenda](#commons-agenda).)
* **The Rite** → ritual-style gatherings of chants, art, science, music, dance, healing, and joy. (See [Rite Agenda](#rite-agenda).)

Together, Commons and Rite form a cycle: **Commons → Rite → Commons**. The Commons provides direction and solidarity; the Rite provides energy, healing, and connection.

**Who it’s for:** anyone seeking solidarity, healing, justice, and imagination — especially marginalized communities (queer, BIPOC, disabled, unsheltered, low-income, displaced).
**What it’s for:** to heal, grow, rest, plan, resist, and celebrate.
**Why it exists:** to weave together political action (Commons) and cultural-spiritual experience (Rite) into a living practice.

## 🦋 Principles

* **Souls, not attendees** → everyone present is a soul, equal in dignity. (See [Glossary](#-glossary).)
* **Radical hospitality & empathy (with boundaries)** → all who come in good faith are welcome; harm is addressed.
* **Consent & exit** → opt-in for touch/photos/participation; leaving is always okay. (See [Safety](#-safety).)
* **Access** → quiet spaces, seating, captions/printouts; access notes required. (See [Spaces](#-spaces).)
* **Science & reality** → celebrate truth-seeking; distinguish reality from artificial "real world."
* **Anti-denial & accountability** → name harm, compost it into repair.
* **Mutual aid & reciprocity** → help each other meet needs, redistribute resources. (See [Mutual Aid Space](#-spaces).)
* **Decentralization** → rotating roles, local autonomy, remixable content. (See [Roles & Rotations](#-roles--rotations).)
* **Anti-profit** → sliding-scale, transparency, mutual aid first.
* **License** → [CC0 1.0](LICENSE) so ideas remain in the commons.
* **No leaders, only stewards** → roles share work, not power. (See [No Leaders, Only Stewards](#-no-leaders-only-stewards).)

Applies to both Commons and Rite.

## 🕸️ Structure

Liberation Mass is both **Commons** and **Rite**, two faces of one whole.

### Commons (Coalition mode)

* Testimonies from impacted voices.
* Coalition-style updates with clear asks.
* Small groups synthesize into campaigns.
* Planning across tracks: policy, grassroots safety, coordination.
* Inspired by models like Flagstaff Community Coalition.

See [Commons Agenda](#commons-agenda).

### Rite (Mass mode)

* Invocation chants and music.
* Testimonies witnessed collectively.
* Science-as-sacred rituals, art, drag, dance.
* Communion through shared food and acts of repair.
* Closing benediction (e.g., *No gods, no masters, only us*).
* Inspired by radical cultural events like Wrecking Ball.

See [Rite Agenda](#rite-agenda).

### Cycle

The Commons gives direction. The Rite gives energy. Together, they sustain movements and communities.

## 🦇 Roles & Rotations

Liberation Mass has **no fixed leaders**. Roles rotate seasonally, with at least two people per role.

* **Guides** — facilitate flow, open and close gatherings.
* **Weavers** — outreach, connection, cross-pollination.
* **Stewards** — safety, consent, access, aftercare. (See [Safety](#-safety).)
* **Witnesses** — hold space for testimonies.
* **Wolves** — convene trainings and skillshares.
* **Ravens** — experienced advisors, offering insight without holding power.

Roles are not authority; they are shared care. (See [No Leaders, Only Stewards](#-no-leaders-only-stewards).)

## 🌱 Spaces

Liberation Mass is an ecosystem of spaces:

* **Healing Space** — grief support, mentoring, rituals of release.
* **Growth Space** — skillshares, DIY, art, science demos.
* **Being Space** — sanctuary for quiet rest, sensory relief, reflection.
* **Commons Space** — testimonies, planning, coalition work.
* **Play Space** — drag, dance, live music, performance.
* **Mutual Aid Space** — free store, resource sharing, sign-ups.
* **Creation Space** — collaborative art wall, instruments, maker tables.
* **Spiritual-but-Not Space** — altar, science as sacred, meaning rituals.
* **Kids & Families Space** — childcare, art, radical play.
* **Food & Nourishment Space** — potlucks, tea, shared meals.
* **Conflict & Mediation Space** — restorative process, de-escalation. (See [Safety](#-safety).)

Souls flow freely between spaces; no path is mandatory.

## 🛡️ Safety

Safety applies to both Commons and Rite.

* **Consent** — always ask before touch/photos; use opt-in systems.

* **Stewards** — rotating care roles, de-escalation basics, med kit.
* **Aftercare** — guidance for participants and hosts on decompression and follow-up.

Anyone may host or contribute. Visibility does not equal authority. Liberation Mass is open-source and remixable.

## 🌌 Liberation Mass in the Living Spectrum

Liberation Mass is one branch of the **Living Spectrum** — an ecosystem of interdependent sequences (curiosity, intelligence, empathy, love, liberation, compost). It embodies:

* **Abolition & anarchism** → non-hierarchy, mutual aid, liberation.
* **Solarpunk** → regenerative, ecological, imaginative futures.
* **Root Sequence philosophy** → life, death, compost, rebirth cycles. (See the [Root Sequence project](../root-sequence/README.md).)

It is both **practical** (planning, safety, campaigns) and **poetic** (ritual, music, healing, science as sacred).
