# Federation of Liberation Mass Nodes

Liberation Mass is not one organization. It is many nodes, connected by shared principles and open-source practices.

---

## What is a Node?

* A local group that hosts Commons and/or Rite gatherings.
* Can be as small as a living room circle or as large as a community hall event.
* Uses the Liberation Mass materials as inspiration, not prescription.

---

## Minimum Commitments

* **Safety & Access** → share access notes, provide quiet space, honor consent.
* **Aftercare** → support participants after intense gatherings.
* **Rotation of Roles** → Guides, Stewards, Weavers, Wolves, Ravens, Witnesses.
* **Commons + Rite Balance** → at least some space for planning and some space for celebration.

---

## How Nodes Stay Connected

* **Online** → federated platforms (Mastodon, Matrix, encrypted pads).
* **Offline** → zine swaps, travel exchanges, cross-city visits.
* **Registry (optional)** → public list of nodes that want to be discoverable.

---

## Autonomy & Remix

* Each node decides its own frequency, style, and focus.
* Modules are meant to be remixed and adapted.
* Shared under CC0 → nothing is proprietary.

---

## Example Paths

* **Neighborhood node** → monthly living-room Commons + quarterly Rite.
* **Campus node** → study group Commons + open-mic Rite.
* **City-wide node** → coalition Commons + large Wrecking Ball–style Rite.

**Remember:** Federation is about connection without centralization.
Every node is autonomous, but together we form a wider web of solidarity.
