# Commons Log Aggregation (docs/commons-log-aggregation.md)

How to combine themes and learnings from multiple node logs into a federation-wide memory.

---

## Principles

* **Anonymity:** never include names or identifying details
* **Themes not transcripts:** capture patterns, not raw data
* **Accessibility:** keep summary short, clear, and shareable

---

## Process

1. **Collect Logs**

   * Each node shares their `commons-log.md` entries after gatherings
   * Use encrypted or trusted channel if sensitive

2. **Sift for Themes**

   * Look for repeating words, emotions, and needs
   * Group into categories (grief, joy, repair, seeds, conflict, solidarity)

3. **Summarize**

   * Write 1–2 sentence summary per category
   * Add “emerging questions” section for unresolved themes

4. **Share Back**

   * Post to federation repo or seasonal convergence
   * Print mini-report for zine distribution

## Example

**Node A:** seeds of solidarity, conflict around roles
**Node B:** grief compost, strong art & dance energy
**Node C:** repair focus, request for more accessibility

**Aggregated Summary:** Across nodes, themes of solidarity and grief emerged. Repair remains central, with accessibility as a growing need. Art & dance provided energy and resilience. Questions remain about role clarity and federation decision-making.

---

**In short:** Aggregation builds a memory commons without surveillance — just patterns, learnings, and questions.
