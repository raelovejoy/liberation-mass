# Principles (v0.3)

Liberation Mass is guided by principles that shape both its faces: the **Commons** (coalition mode) and the **Rite** (mass/ritual mode). These principles help us create spaces that are liberatory, accessible, and open to all souls.

## 🌱 Why These Principles Matter

Principles keep us oriented when conditions change. Without them, groups drift toward hierarchy, exclusion, or burnout. These principles are the compass that ensures Liberation Mass stays true to its vision.

### Problems When Principles Are Absent:
* Hierarchy creeps in when roles and practices aren’t guided by shared values.
* Exclusion emerges when access, care, and equity are not centered.
* Burnout grows when sustainability and rotation are ignored.
* Co-optation happens when movements lack clarity about their commitments.

### Our Alternative:
* Care first: dignity, safety, and consent are never negotiable.
* Rotation and renewal: roles, practices, and leadership are always shared.
* Commons mindset: resources and knowledge are open and shared back.
* Liberation focus: every action connects to the larger struggle for freedom.

## 🌑 Core Principles

* **Souls, not attendees** — everyone present is a soul, equal in dignity.
* **Radical hospitality & empathy (with boundaries)** — all who come in good faith are welcome; harm is addressed.
* **Consent & exit** — opt-in for touch/photos/participation; leaving is always okay.
* **Access** — publish access notes, provide quiet/chill spaces, aim for captions.
* **Science & reality** — celebrate truth-seeking; distinguish reality from the artificial “real world.”
* **Anti-denial & accountability** — name harm; witness it; compost it into repair.
* **Mutual aid & reciprocity** — help each other meet needs; share resources and care.
* **Decentralization** — rotating roles, local autonomy, remixable content.
* **Anti-profit** — sliding-scale, transparency, mutual aid first.
* **No leaders, only stewards** — roles exist to share work, not power.
* **License** — CC0 (public domain) so ideas remain in the commons.

* Decentralization and transparency.
* Access notes for meetings.

### Rite (Mass Mode)

## 🌌 Ties to Wider Movements

Liberation Mass principles are rooted in and connected to:

* **Abolition & anarchism** → no hierarchy, mutual aid, freedom from domination.
* **Solarpunk** → regenerative, ecological, imaginative futures.
* **Living Spectrum / Root Sequence** → cycles of curiosity, intelligence, empathy, love, liberation, compost.

These principles guide every Mass, whether Commons or Rite, large or small, local or global.
