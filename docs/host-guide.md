# How to Host a Liberation Mass (docs/host-guide.md)

A starter guide for anyone preparing to host a Liberation Mass.

---

## 1. Before the Gathering

* **Choose Flow**: Decide on Rite, Commons, and Specialized flow (see `FLOWS.md`).
* **Select Modules**: Pick 2–3 modules (e.g. Witness, Communion, Repair) that fit context.
* **Assign Roles**:

  * Guides/Hosts → frame, narrate, keep time
  * Stewards → safety, access, consent
  * Runners → supplies, setup, cleanup
  * Tech/DJ → music, sound, slides
* **Prepare Space**:

  * Ritual hall, kitchen commons, dance floor, garden (see `spaces/`)
  * Quiet lane & opt-out zones
* **Gather Supplies**: See `SUPPLIES.md` for checklists.
* **Safety Prep**:

  * Review `safety/consent-practices.md` and `safety/conflict-resolution.md`
  * Stock first aid kit, earplugs, signage

## 2. During the Gathering

* **Opening (Invocation)**:

  * Share chant & norms
  * Introduce roles & signals
* **Modules**:

  * Run in chosen sequence (see `RUN-OF-SHOW.md`)
  * Keep time, announce transitions
* **Safety**:

  * Stewards monitor consent, access, and conflict
  * Announce tap-out and quiet space availability
* **Commons Log**:

  * Scribe captures witness themes, repairs, seeds (see `commons-log.md`)

## 3. Closing & Aftercare

* **Closing Words**: Use chants or gratitude circle
* **Announcements**: Share next gathering, resources, federation ties
* **Cleanup**: Assign roles; compost food, recycle, reset space
* **Aftercare**:

  * Encourage hydration, grounding, buddy check-ins
  * Share `zines/aftercare.md`

---

## 4. After the Gathering

* **Review Commons Log**: Share anonymized themes with community/federation
* **Check-in with Team**: What worked, what to adjust
* **Follow-ups**: Safety or access issues addressed

**Remember:** Hosting is about holding space, not perfection. Predictable flows + consent-first practices make gatherings safe, adaptable, and meaningful.
