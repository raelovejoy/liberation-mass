# Federation Handbook (docs/federation-handbook.md)

A consolidated guide for organizing Liberation Mass across multiple nodes.

---

## 1. Principles

* Autonomy with solidarity
* Consent-first, vegan-default, repair > replace
* Commons before commodity
* Memory without surveillance

---

## 2. Starter Pack

See `federation-starter-pack.md` for launching a new node:

* Gather core crew (3–5 roles)
* Choose flow + modules
* Prep space, supplies, safety
* Log outcomes with `commons-log.md`

---

## 3. Working Groups

See `federation-and-working-groups.md`:

* Safety Stewards
* Ops Crew
* Art & Zines
* Seeds & Repair
* Tech & Memory

Charters cover: purpose, roles, practices, accountability.

---

## 4. Seasonal Convergence

See `seasonal-convergence.md`:

* Held 2–4 times a year
* Structure: Opening Rite → Module Exchange → Commons Review → Skillshares → Assembly → Closing
* Roles: Convergence Host Crew, Memory Stewards, Safety Stewards
* Commons sharing: zines, logs, seeds, repair tools

---

## 5. Commons Log Aggregation

See `commons-log-aggregation.md`:

* Collect logs from nodes
* Identify themes (grief, joy, repair, seeds, solidarity)
* Summarize in short, accessible format
* Share at convergence + federation repo

---

## 6. Decision Protocols

See `federation-decision-protocols.md`:

* Consent rounds
* 3–2–1 Rule
* Circles (time-bound, all voices)
* Document all decisions in Commons Log

---

## 7. Sharing Back

* Post aggregated learnings in federation repo
* Print zine/PDF recaps for accessibility
* Rotate stewards across nodes for cross-training

---

**In short:** The federation thrives on lightweight coordination — flows, memory, and solidarity across autonomous nodes.
