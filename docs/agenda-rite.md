3. **Skillshare / Teaching Moment**

   * A brief workshop, science demo, or knowledge offering.
   * Could be led by *Wolves* (trainers) or *Stewards* (safety practices).
   * Links Commons learning with Rite energy.

4. **Communion / Sharing**

   * Share food, water, or seeds.
   * Repair or mend something together, or plant as a symbolic act.
   * *Stewards* ensure inclusivity and access.

5. **Art & Dance**

## Safety Notes

* *Stewards* maintain consent, access, and aftercare spaces.
* Use opt-in systems for touch, dance, and photos.
* Encourage quiet decompression spaces after high-energy sections.

## Purpose

The Rite agenda ensures:

* Testimonies are witnessed with care.
* Healing and celebration are integrated.
* Skillshares and rituals keep the Mass alive and remixable.
* Energy flows back into the Commons for planning and action.

## Roles Reminder

This agenda works best when Circles (Roles of Care) are filled. See [roles.md](../roles.md) for details.
