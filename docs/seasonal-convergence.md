# Seasonal Convergence Guide (docs/seasonal-convergence.md)

A guide for organizing federation-wide seasonal gatherings of Liberation Mass nodes.

---

## Purpose

* Share practices, zines, and flows
* Cross-train Stewards and Hosts
* Build solidarity and memory across nodes

---

## Timing

* Suggested: 2â€“4 times per year (solstices, equinoxes, or chosen community dates)
* Duration: half-day to full weekend

---

## Structure

1. **Opening Rite** (shared chant, invocation)
2. **Module Exchange** (each node demos a module)
3. **Commons Log Review** (themes, learnings across nodes)
4. **Skillshares** (repair, seeds, art, self-defense)
5. **Assembly** (discussion of federation matters)
6. **Closing Ritual** (gratitude, convergence chant)

---

## Roles

* **Convergence Host Crew**: rotates between nodes
* **Memory Stewards**: scribe shared themes into federation log
* **Safety Stewards**: uphold access, consent, emergency readiness

---

## Commons Sharing

* Each node brings:

  * Local zines
  * Commons log highlights
  * Seeds, repair kits, or cultural offerings

---

**Reminder:** Seasonal convergences are for connection, not hierarchy. Keep lightweight, joyful, and reciprocal.
