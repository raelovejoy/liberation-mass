# Working Groups

Working Groups are small, focused circles that carry Commons decisions into action. They can be temporary (for a specific project) or ongoing (for sustained needs).

### 2. Grassroots Safety & Mutual Aid

* Build direct, on-the-ground safety nets.
* Coordinate community defense, bystander trainings, self-defense dojos.

## How They Work

* Formed during Commons gatherings based on testimonies + synthesis.
* Each group picks at least one **point person** for follow-up.
* Roles rotate to prevent burnout.
* Report-backs happen at the next Commons.

## Starting a Working Group

1. Identify a need (from testimonies or updates).
2. Form a circle (3â€“12 people).
3. Agree on next steps and timeline.
4. Record commitments and share with Commons.
5. Dissolve when purpose is complete or hand off to another group.

Working Groups = the **hands of Liberation Mass**.
They turn shared vision into concrete action.
