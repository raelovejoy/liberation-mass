# Sample Announcements & Closing Scripts (docs/sample-scripts.md)

Short, repeatable words for hosts to use during gatherings. Adapt tone to context.

---

## Opening / Invocation

"Welcome, everyone. This is a Liberation Mass — a space of care, witness, and commons. Our norms are simple: consent first, vegan default, and repair over replace. If you need to opt out at any time, place your hand to your heart and step back. A quiet lane and quiet space are always available. Together we begin."

(Chant option: *We… We… Fight… Fight… Together… Until we are free.*)

---

## Transition Between Modules

"We’re moving now into \[module name]. Take a deep breath, reset, and remember you can always opt in or out."

---

## Announcements (Closing)

"Before we close, a few announcements: \[upcoming events / needs / next gathering date]. Please check the commons table for zines, seeds, and notes. Add to the Commons Log if you’d like to share a theme or learning."

---

## Closing Words

"We end as we began: in care, in witness, in solidarity."

(Call & Response: *Take what you need. Leave what you can. Meet us again.*)

---

## Aftercare Reminder

"Drink some water, eat something nourishing, and check in with a buddy if you can. Copies of the Aftercare zine are available at the door."

---

*These scripts are optional scaffolds: simple, repeatable, and adaptable.*
