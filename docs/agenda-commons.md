**2. Testimonies from Impacted Souls**

* Those most affected speak first.
* *Witnesses* hold space and respond collectively (*We see you. We hear you.*).

**3. Coalition Updates**

* Groups and projects give short updates.
* Clear asks: what support, resources, or turnout are needed?
* *Weavers* help highlight overlaps and cross-pollination.

* Identify themes and next steps.

**5. Collective Synthesis**

* Grassroots safety & mutual aid.
