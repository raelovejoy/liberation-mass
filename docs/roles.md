# Roles & Rotations

Liberation Mass has **no leaders**. Instead, it is held together by rotating roles that share care and responsibility. Roles are seasonal, with at least two souls per role so knowledge is passed on. One may stay while another rotates in.

## 🚫 Why We Don’t Have Leaders

Authority — even with good intentions — tends to reproduce the systems we seek to undo. By refusing fixed leadership, we prevent hierarchy from forming and keep liberation alive in practice, not just in words.

**Problems with Leaders & Authority:**

* **Power Concentration**: Decisions narrow to a few voices, silencing diversity.
* **Dependency**: People look to leaders instead of building shared capacity.
* **Accountability Gaps**: Authority shields those at the top from challenge.
* **Reproduction of Oppression**: Hierarchy mirrors capitalism, patriarchy, white supremacy, and the state.
* **Fragility**: When a leader burns out or leaves, the whole effort weakens.

**Our Alternative:**

* Roles are **tools, not thrones**.
* **Authority rests in the circle, not a person.** Everyone is accountable, everyone is capable.
* **Resilience comes from distribution.** Shared responsibility means the movement cannot be decapitated.

## 🌑 Circles (Roles of Care)

### Guides

* Facilitate the flow of gatherings.
* Open and close Commons or Rite sessions.
* Keep time gently and support the agenda.
* Hold space with warmth and clarity.

### Weavers

* Outreach and connection between groups, communities, and nodes.
* Prevent duplication of work by linking efforts.
* Bring new souls into the Mass through relationship-building.
* Inspired by the “spiders” role in past coalitions.

### Stewards

* Caretakers of safety, consent, access, and aftercare.
* Ensure Access Notes are published and visible.
* Maintain quiet rooms and decompression spaces.
* Not security — stewards are guides of care, not enforcers.

### Witnesses

* Hold space for testimonies and stories from impacted souls.
* Practice listening without interruption.
* Reflect back what is shared in collective affirmations (e.g., *We see you. We hear you. We hold you.*).

### Wolves

* Convene trainings, workshops, and skillshares.
* Ensure knowledge is passed on across groups.
* Support both Commons (organizing skills) and Rite (embodied practices like self-defense or dance).

### Ravens

* Advisory role — experienced voices who provide insight and history.
* Attend gatherings to support with perspective.
* Do not hold decision-making power.

## 🕸️ Role Ecology

Roles exist in balance:

* **Commons emphasis** → Weavers, Witnesses, Guides.
* **Rite emphasis** → Guides, Stewards, Wolves.
* **Both** → Ravens can support either face.

## 🌱 Rotation Practices

* Roles rotate every season or cycle (local groups may define timing).
* At least two souls per role; one may continue while another rotates in.
* Rotation prevents hierarchy and spreads skills.

---

## 🕯️ Principles

* Roles exist to **share work, not power**.
* Stewards are not leaders.
* All souls are equal in dignity.

Liberation Mass is a commons. Roles keep the cycle alive without creating hierarchy.
