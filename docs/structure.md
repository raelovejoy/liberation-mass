# Structure of Liberation Mass

Liberation Mass is not one thing. It is **two interwoven forms** that feed each other:

* **Commons** â†’ planning, coordination, testimonies, and action.
* **Rite** â†’ ritual, celebration, art, and healing.

Together, they create a rhythm of solidarity: listening, acting, healing, and celebrating.

## ðŸŒ± Why Structure This Way

The way we organize shapes the outcomes we create. Hierarchical structures often reproduce domination and exclusion, even when the intentions are good. Our structure is designed to resist these traps:

**Problems with Hierarchy & Centralization:**

* **Concentration of power** leads to domination and gatekeeping.
* **Dependence on authority** discourages initiative and mutual aid.
* **Accountability gaps** arise when decisions flow downward, not across.
* **Fragility** grows when a system depends on a few central figures or institutions.

**Our Alternative:**

* **Distributed power**: decisions are made where they affect people most.
* **Commons orientation**: resources, knowledge, and care are shared.
* **Interdependence**: groups and nodes support one another without control.
* **Resilience through diversity**: multiple circles, roles, and practices prevent collapse if one part falters.

## The Commons

* A space to plan and coordinate across groups.
* Shares updates, testimonies, and concrete asks.
* Breaks into small groups for synthesis and action tracks.
* Inspired by coalition practices like the Flagstaff Community Coalition.

**Purpose:** prevent duplication of work, center impacted voices, and build shared strategies.

## The Rite

* A space to gather in ritual and celebration.
* Uses chants, testimonies, skillshares, food, and dance.
* Healing and joy are as important as action.
* Inspired by concerts, vigils, drag shows, Wrecking Ball, and post-punk/goth ritual energy.

**Purpose:** sustain the heart of the movement through culture, art, and collective spirit.

## How They Interweave

* **Commons** identifies struggles, strategies, and needs.
* **Rite** transforms grief into energy, raises funds, and strengthens bonds.
* Together, they form a cycle: *Action â†’ Healing â†’ Action â†’ Healing.*

---

## Monthly Rhythm (example)

* **Week 1:** Commons meeting (planning & testimonies).
* **Week 3:** Rite gathering (ritual, art, fundraising).
* **Ongoing:** Working groups, mutual aid, trainings.

---

## Key Principles

* Roles rotate seasonally (Guides, Weavers, Stewards, Wolves, Ravens, Witnesses).
* Safety, access, and aftercare are built in from the start.
* Every node adapts the structure to local context.
* Open-source: all materials are CC0 â€” copy, remix, and share back.

Liberation Mass = **Commons + Rite**.
Together they hold space for planning, healing, and imagining new worlds.
