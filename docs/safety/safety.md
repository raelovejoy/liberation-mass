# Safety (Consent, Access, OpSec — public-safe)

Safety and care are at the heart of Liberation Mass, in both Commons and Rite. Safety is collective, stewarded, and non-punitive wherever possible.

## 🌑 Core Practices

* **Consent** — always ask before touch/photos/recording. Use clear systems (e.g., colored lanyards or wristbands) for preferences.
* **Access** — publish [Access Notes](access-notes-template.md) before each gathering. Provide quiet/chill spaces, seating, captions, or printouts where possible.
* **Stewards** — rotating roles responsible for safety, consent, access, and aftercare. Stewards are not security; they are caretakers.
* **Aftercare** — gatherings can bring up strong feelings. Provide guidance and support. See [Aftercare Guide](aftercare-guide.md).
* **OpSec (high-level)** — do not share sensitive details (exact locations, names, security plans) publicly. Use encrypted channels (Signal, Matrix E2EE) for planning. Compartmentalize need-to-know information.
* **De-escalation & conflict care** — train stewards in basic de-escalation; prioritize restorative responses over punitive measures.

## 🛡️ In Commons (Coalition Mode)

* Clear access notes at the start of each meeting.
* Stewards monitor space for consent violations, accessibility issues, or harm.
* Testimonies may surface trauma → provide aftercare connections.
* No recording without explicit opt-in.

## 🕯️ In Rite (Mass Mode)

* Consent is sacred: opt-in for touch, dance, photography.
* Spaces include Healing, Being, and Conflict/Mediation.
* Stewards hold aftercare spaces and guide souls to rest/support.
* OpSec applies to photos, livestreams, and location data.

## 🌱 Steward Guidelines

* Stewards rotate every gathering; at least 2–3 active at any time.
* Responsibilities:

  * Consent systems (lanyards, signage, reminders).
  * Accessibility check (quiet room, seating, captions).
  * Aftercare facilitation (quiet space, debrief, resources).
  * De-escalation (gentle, non-punitive care).
* Stewards are not authority figures. They share work, not power.
