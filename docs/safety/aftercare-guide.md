# Aftercare Guide (for Participants & Hosts)

Gatherings can bring up strong feelings, energy, or fatigue. Aftercare helps everyone land safely.

---

## For Participants

* **Hydrate & eat**: drink water, have a meal/snack.
* **Rest**: find quiet time; naps are valid.
* **Process**: journal, draw, or talk with a trusted friend about what came up.
* **Move gently**: stretch, walk, or shake off tension.
* **Reach out**: if you’re struggling, connect with someone from the gathering or a support hotline.

## For Hosts

* **Debrief**: check in with co-hosts; share feelings and logistics notes.
* **Clean-up with care**: leave the space as you found it.
* **Follow-up**: send thank-you notes, photos (if consented), and resources.
* **Check in**: reach out to participants who seemed activated, if safe/appropriate.

## Resources

* Local crisis or peer support hotlines
* Mutual aid networks
* Online support communities (trauma-informed, queer-friendly, disability-friendly)

**Reminder**: Aftercare isn’t optional—it’s part of the gathering itself.
