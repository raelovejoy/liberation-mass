# Federation Decision Protocols (docs/federation-decision-protocols.md)

Lightweight reference for making decisions across nodes.

---

## Principles

* **Consent-based:** aim for “good enough for now, safe enough to try”
* **Transparency:** decisions documented in Commons Log
* **Rotation:** no permanent leadership; roles rotate

---

## Core Methods

### 1. Consent Rounds

* Proposal shared → clarifying questions → quick reactions → consent check
* Responses: Agree / Consent with reservations / Block
* Blocks require reason + alternative path

### 2. 3–2–1 Rule

* **3 options** drafted
* **2 rounds** of feedback
* **1 decision** taken

### 3. Circles

* Convene when issues affect all nodes
* Everyone speaks once before repeats
* Time-bound (max 90 minutes)

---

## Documentation

* Summaries logged in federation Commons Log
* Zine or PDF recap shared for transparency

---

## Escalation

* If decision can’t be reached: pause → test small experiment locally → revisit at next convergence

---

**In short:** Keep decisions small, reversible, and documented. Federation is about coordination, not control.
