# Liturgy (Rite Mode)

Liberation Mass in **Rite mode** is a living ritual: chants, testimonies, art, science, and celebration. The flow can be adapted for context, but this agenda provides a shared rhythm.

## ðŸŒ‘ Rite Agenda

**1. Invocation**

* A chant or call-and-response that unites souls in rhythm.
* Example:

  * Leader: *Weâ€¦*
  * Souls: *Weâ€¦*
  * Leader: *Fightâ€¦*
  * Souls: *Fightâ€¦*
  * All (building): *Togetherâ€¦ togetherâ€¦ until we are free.*

**2. Witnessing**

* Testimonies from impacted souls.
* Collective response: *We see you. We hear you. We hold you.*

**3. Ritual Modules**

* Optional add-ons that bring the Rite alive. Examples:

  * **Science & Reality Rite** â€” stars, microscopes, resonance patterns.
  * **Compost Rite** â€” grief-to-soil ritual.
  * **Drag & Performance** â€” art as liberation.

**4. Communion**

* Share food & water, tea, or seeds.
* Acts of repair: mend clothes, plant something, fix broken tech.

**5. Play & Celebration**

* Dance, music, drag, performance.
* A queer/abolitionist energy space like the Wrecking Ball.

**6. Closing Benediction**

* Example whisper: *No gods. No masters. Only us.*
* Or a chant reframed for hope: *Real, real, living, real.*

## ðŸ”® Notes

* The Rite can be solemn, joyful, quiet, or loud â€” or all at once.
* Modules allow endless remixing; no two Rites are the same.
* The goal is solidarity, healing, and energy for the Commons.

## ðŸŒŒ Ties to Commons

The Rite sustains the Commons. After ritual comes planning. After action comes ritual. This cycle is what makes Liberation Mass both resilient and alive.
