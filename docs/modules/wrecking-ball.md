# Module: Wrecking Ball

**Aim:** A radical queer & abolitionist dance party that raises funds for mutual aid while building culture and joy.

---

## Origins

* Inspired by the Flagstaff Community Coalition’s *Wrecking Ball* (2016–2018).
* A mix of concert, party, and fundraiser.
* Served as both cultural glue and material support for community struggles.

## Flow

1. **Opening** → Welcome, access notes, and why we gather.
2. **Performances** → drag, live bands, DJs, spoken word.
3. **Fundraising Moment** → donations for bail/bond fund, mutual aid, or direct community support.
4. **Dance Party** → long, joyful release.
5. **Closing Reflection** → gratitude, announcements, collective chant.

## Access & Safety

* Share access notes in advance (sound, lighting, mobility).
* Provide quiet/chill room.
* Use consent-based photography system (lanyards or wristbands).
* Ensure water, seating, and safe transport options.

## Variations

* Benefit for a specific cause (legal defense, housing, medical aid).
* Theme nights (goth, solarpunk, masquerade).
* Pair with zine tables, art shows, or mutual aid fairs.

## Why It Matters

* Embodied joy keeps movements alive.
* Fundraising ties celebration directly to survival.
* Queer & abolitionist framing centers liberation and care.
* Creates memories that bind communities together.
