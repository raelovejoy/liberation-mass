# Testimony & Witness (docs/modules/testimony-witness.md)

**Purpose:** Make experience legible without debate. Practice collective witnessing.

## Objectives

* Short, time-bound sharings with predictable response: "We see you. We hear you. We hold you."
* Build narrative memory across gatherings (themes, learnings).

## Flow (10–25 min)

1. **Frame**: "You can pass. Share only what's safe to share."
2. **Open Mic**: 60–120 sec per speaker; timer visible.
3. **Witness**: group response; no cross-talk.
4. **Archive**: optional written card to add to Commons Memory (anonymous by default).

## Roles

* **Timekeeper**: visible clock, soft chime.
* **Host**: maintains container, reminds consent & anonymity.
* **Scribe**: captures themes (not names) to the Commons log.

## Prompts

* "What did you repair this week?"
* "Where did you feel held?"

## Access

* Quiet corner mic; or text-to-speech option; card-only share is valid.
