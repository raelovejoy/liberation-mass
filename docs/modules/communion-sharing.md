# Communion / Sharing (docs/modules/communion-sharing.md)

**Purpose:** Practice abundance, reciprocity, and care in material form.

## Objectives

* Share food, water, tea, or seeds as a commons (not charity).
* Normalize mutual aid (ask → offer → accept → reciprocate).
* Embed access-first practices (clear labeling, allergens, vegan default).

## Quick Run-of-Show (15–25 min)

1. **Set**: Cloth/table altar with water, fruits, bread, or rice; seed bowls.
2. **Name**: "We feed each other." (Call & response below.)
3. **Rotate**: Invite small groups to share, hydrate, and leave 1 thing for the next group.
4. **Seed**: Offer seeds to take home; invite seed-lending commitments.
5. **Close**: Gratitude circle: one word each.

## Roles

* **Steward**: oversees safety, labeling, cleanliness.
* **Host**: welcomes, narrates the practice, keeps time.
* **Runner**: refills water, wipes surfaces, tracks supplies.

## Materials

* Water station, cups, napkins, compost bin; seed bowls and envelopes.
* Labels: ingredients, allergens; "vegan" default signage.

## Script: Call & Response

* Lead: *Who keeps us alive?*
  All: **We do.**
* Lead: *What do we share?*
  All: **Enough for all.**
* Lead: *How do we eat?*
  All: **With care, with joy, with each other.**

## Access & Safety

* Quiet lane for low-stim folks; seated option.
* Food safety: gloves/tongs, cleaning schedule, hand-sanitizer.
* Allergy protocol: clear signage; announce before opening table.

## Variations

* **Water Rite**: pass cups, speak blessings for those absent.
