# Module: Grief → Compost Ritual

**Aim:** To transform grief, rage, or loss into collective strength and renewal.

---

## Flow

1. **Gathering** → Stewards welcome souls, explain the ritual, share access notes.
2. **Naming Grief** → each person may speak, write, or silently hold a grief.

   * Options: write on paper, hold a stone, whisper into soil.
3. **Witnessing** → group responds with: *We see you. We hear you. We hold you.*
4. **Composting Act** →

   * Burn or shred written griefs and add to compost/soil.
   * Place stones in water or soil as offerings.
5. **Planting or Renewal** → plant seeds, bulbs, or symbolic objects in the composted soil.
6. **Closing** → circle chant: *From grief, we grow. From loss, we rise.*

## Access & Safety

* Offer quiet space for those overwhelmed.
* Participation is optional at every step.
* Use non-toxic, safe materials (no harsh smoke).
* Provide ways to participate silently (writing, gesture).

## Variations

* Pair with music (drone, cello, ambient soundscape).
* Use art instead of soil (collage, painting over grief words).
* Do the ritual outdoors in a garden, or indoors with potted plants.

## Why It Matters

* Acknowledges grief as part of life and struggle.
* Offers a collective way to hold and transform pain.
* Connects death/decay with renewal/creation.
* Keeps the Living Spectrum whole: joy *and* sorrow.

**Grief → Compost** = a cycle of transformation.
It helps souls metabolize pain into soil for future liberation.
