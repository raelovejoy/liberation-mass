# Modules

Modules are **optional add-ons** you can use to shape your Liberation Mass.
They can be small (a chant, a reading) or large (a dance party, a science rite).

## What is a Module?

* A self-contained ritual, activity, or practice.
* Can be plugged into a Commons or Rite agenda.
* Shared openly so others can copy, remix, and adapt.

## Examples

* **Science & Reality Rite** → microscopes, astronomy readings, resonance experiments.
* **Grief → Compost Ritual** → collective mourning, composting symbols, renewal.
* **Dance Benediction** → a closing dance floor with live music/DJ.
* **Wrecking Ball** → radical queer/abolitionist dance party, fundraising for mutual aid.
* **Zinefest Table** → make and share zines onsite.

## How to Create a Module

1. Name it.
2. Describe its purpose.
3. Write a short step-by-step (5–15 min or more).
4. Add access notes (noise, lights, mobility, consent requirements).
5. Save as a new file in `docs/modules/`.

## Why Modules?

* Keep Liberation Mass flexible and creative.
* Let groups remix and share practices.
* Build a growing library of rituals and activities.
* Encourage cultural exchange across nodes.

**Tip:** Start simple. Even a single chant or a circle of introductions can be a module.
