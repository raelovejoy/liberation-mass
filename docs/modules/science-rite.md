# Module: Science & Reality Rite

**Aim:** Celebrate truth-seeking; pierce the veil between reality and the artificial "real world."

---

## Flow
1. **Astronomy Reading** → project stars/nebulae and read a short text like scripture.  
2. **Biology Reveal** → microscope cam of pond water or plant cells.  
3. **Physics Resonance** → vibration patterns (e.g., salt on a plate) with low drone sound.  
4. **Chant Refrain** → *real, real, living, real* between segments.  
5. **Closing Line** → *They sold us a world of offices and debt; reality is roots, rivers, photons, and souls.*

## Access & Safety
- Provide quiet space for those overwhelmed by sound/light.  
- Avoid strobe lights; keep projections accessible.  
- Share clear notes on sensory environment.

---

## Variations
- Pair with live music (ambient, drone).  
- Use science sonifications (e.g., pulsar recordings, climate data turned into sound).  
- Host it outdoors under the night sky.

## Why It Matters
- Centers science and knowledge as sacred, without religion.  
- Connects people to reality, not the artificial “real world.”  
- Inspires awe, curiosity, and collective wonder.
