# Contributing New Modules (CONTRIBUTING-MODULES.md)

Guidelines for adding new modules to Liberation Mass.

---

## 1. Purpose of Modules

Modules are building blocks of flows. Each should:

* Serve a clear purpose (ritual, repair, skill, art, sharing)
* Be accessible and consent-first
* Be lightweight (15â€“40 minutes)

---

## 2. File Location

* Add to: `docs/modules/`
* Use lowercase, hyphenated filenames (e.g., `story-circle.md`)

---

## 3. Required Sections

Each module should include:

* **Title** (# Heading with module name)
* **Purpose** (why it exists)
* **Objectives** (what participants should get out of it)
* **Flow** (step-by-step timing and actions)
* **Roles** (who leads, supports, ensures safety)
* **Materials** (supplies needed)
* **Access & Safety** (clear accommodations, consent reminders)
* **Variations** (optional tweaks)

---

## 4. Tone & Style

* Write in simple, direct language.
* Use inclusive terms (participants, not attendees).
* Default to vegan, repair, consent-first values.

---

## 5. Example

See `_template.md` in `docs/modules/` for a starter scaffold.

---

## 6. Submitting

* Add your file to a branch or fork.
* Update `index.md` and `mkdocs.yml` to link your module.
* Optional: announce in Commons Log or federation space.
