# Module: Zinefest Table

**Aim:** To create a space for sharing, making, and exchanging zines as part of the Liberation Mass.

---

## Flow

1. **Setup** → Tables with paper, pens, scissors, glue, and photocopies.
2. **Invitation** → Encourage souls to make, share, or browse zines.
3. **Creation Time** → Small groups or individuals design quick zines (poems, safety tips, chants, drawings).
4. **Exchange** → Lay finished zines on a common table for free distribution.
5. **Closing** → Gather leftover zines into bundles to share at other nodes/events.

## Access & Safety

* Provide seating and accessible tables.
* Offer large-print templates or digital formats.
* Make materials free and encourage sharing without cost.

## Variations

* **Theme Zines** → grief, liberation, local history.
* **Collaborative Zines** → one page per person.
* **Skillshare Zines** → how-to guides (first aid, encryption, cooking).
* **Zine Swap** → invite participants to bring zines from their communities.

## Why It Matters

* Zines are a DIY medium for knowledge, art, and solidarity.
* Low-cost, accessible, and remixable.
* Keeps Liberation Mass ideas traveling beyond the gathering.
