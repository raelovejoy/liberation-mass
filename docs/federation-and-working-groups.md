# Federation & Working Groups (docs/federation-and-working-groups.md)

Liberation Mass can scale through lightweight federation and semi-autonomous working groups.

---

## Federation Principles

* **Autonomy:** each node adapts flows to context.
* **Solidarity:** shared symbols, safety norms, and chants.
* **Accountability:** cross-node witnessing, conflict protocols.
* **Commons-first:** resources, zines, and documentation are shared freely.

---

## The Two-Loops Model

* **Ritual Loop** → community gatherings, flows, shared meaning.
* **Ops Loop** → logistics, supplies, safety, federation ties.

These loops overlap but remain distinct to avoid burnout and role confusion.

---

## Working Groups

Examples:

* **Safety Stewards** → consent, access, conflict mediation.
* **Ops Crew** → supplies, spaces, run-of-show.
* **Art & Zines** → design, symbols, mini-zines, digital assets.
* **Seeds & Repair** → mending, planting, commons care.
* **Tech & Memory** → digital tools, commons log, documentation.

## Group Charters

Each group writes a 1-page charter covering:

* Purpose
* Roles & expectations
* Communication channel
* Accountability / reporting method

---

## Decision Protocols

* **Consent-based** (not consensus at all costs).
* **3–2–1 Rule:** 3 options, 2 rounds of feedback, 1 decision.
* **Circles** for big issues: everyone heard, time-bound, documented.

---

## Federation Practices

* Annual or seasonal convergence for cross-node ritual + ops exchange.
* Shared repository of flows, zines, and safety protocols.
* Rotating stewards across nodes to share skills.

---

**In short:** Federation + working groups allow scale without hierarchy, grounding rituals in care, repair, and commons.
