# Culture of Liberation Mass

Liberation Mass is more than agendas and safety notes. It is also art, music, style, and culture — the things that make gatherings alive and magnetic.

## Zines & Print

* Create short zines with chants, poems, safety notes, or art.
* Share them at gatherings and online as PDFs.
* Encourage remixing and translation.
* A zine table can be its own module.

## Art & Design

* **Symbols & Sigils** → simple icons (spider, raven, candle, spectrum lines).
* **Posters & Flyers** → bold, accessible, remix-friendly.
* **DIY aesthetic** → photocopy, collage, hand-drawn.
* **Colors** → goth/post-punk base (black, purple, red) with solarpunk accents (green, gold).

## Music & Sound

* **Chants & Calls** → repeatable, haunting, easy to join.
* **Live Bands / DJs** → goth, post-rock, industrial, darkwave, ambient.

## Performance

## Style & Atmosphere

It turns planning into community, and community into living ritual.
