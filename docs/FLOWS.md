# Liberation Mass Flows (docs/flows.md)

Flows are the structured sequences that guide how a Liberation Mass gathering unfolds. They balance **predictability** (a shared rhythm) with **flexibility** (modular swaps).

---

## Core Principles

* **Every flow opens and closes**: Invocation at the start, Closing at the end.
* **Middle modules are flexible**: Witness, Skillshare, Communion, Art & Dance, Repair, etc.
* **Time can flex**: 60, 90, 120 min templates exist (see `RUN-OF-SHOW.md`).

## Flow Types

### 1. Rite Flow

Structured, ceremonial, symbolic. Includes chants, testimonies, and shared symbolic acts.

* Invocation
* Witness (testimonies + response)
* Skillshare / Teaching
* Communion / Sharing
* Art & Dance
* Closing

### 2. Commons Flow

Informal, community-centered, focused on skillsharing and repair.

* Welcome / Check-in
* Skillshare & Teaching moments
* Repair & Mending, Seed Exchange, or Food Commons
* Art & Storytelling
* Closing (with aftercare + logistics)

### 3. Specialized Flows

Tailored to specific themes or needs. Examples:

* **Grief Compost**: composting grief through ritual, story, and grounding.
* **Science Rite**: knowledge-sharing with demos, experiments.
* **Wrecking Ball**: dismantling oppressive systems (literal or symbolic).

## Why Flows Matter

* Provide rhythm and safety (predictable structure).
* Encourage participation without overwhelm.
* Allow adaptation to context: protest, festival, meeting, memorial, workshop.

---

**In short:** Flows are **blueprints** for moving together through time and space, balancing order with freedom.
