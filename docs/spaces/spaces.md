# Spaces

Liberation Mass is an ecosystem of spaces. Each space meets different needs, and souls flow freely between them. No space is mandatory; all are equal in dignity.

## 🔮 Notes

* Spaces are modular; not every Mass will include every space.
* Nodes can adapt spaces to fit local needs.
* Spaces mirror the Living Spectrum: healing, growth, being, compost.

Liberation Mass is not one space, but many. Together, they form a spectrum of care, creation, and liberation.
