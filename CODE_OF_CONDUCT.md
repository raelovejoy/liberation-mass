# Code of Conduct (Consent & Safety)

Liberation Mass is about care, solidarity, and respect. To keep it welcoming and safe:

## Our commitments

* **Consent**: Always ask before touch, photos, or recording.
* **Access**: Make space usable for as many people as possible (quiet rooms, captions, clear info).
* **Respect**: No harassment, hate, or discrimination.
* **Boundaries**: Honor "no" as a complete sentence.
* **Care**: Support each other, de-escalate conflict, and use restorative approaches where possible.

## Enforcement

* Stewards may ask someone to leave if they ignore boundaries or cause harm.
* Repeat or severe violations may result in permanent exclusion.

## Scope

* Applies to all contributions here (repo, docs, zines) and to gatherings using these materials.
